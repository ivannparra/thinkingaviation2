Regulatory and non-regulatory Airspace

The National Airspace System is divided into two different categories of airspaces. The regulatory and non-regulatory airspaces.

Regulatory airspaces are areas in which the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will make enforcement actions when regulations are not being followed. Examples of regulatory airspaces are, controlled airspaces, uncontrolled airspaces, prohibited areas, and restricted areas

Non-regulatory Airspaces are areas in which the FAA does not make regulatory enforcement due to special operations. Examples of those airspaces are Military Operations Areas (MOA), Warning areas, Alert Areas, and Controlled Firing Areas (CFA).

AIM 3−4−5 (b) Examples of activities conducted in MOAs include, but are not limited to: air combat tactics, air intercepts, aerobatics, formation training, and low−altitude tactics. Military pilots flying in an active MOA are exempted from the provisions of 14 CFR Section 91.303(c) and (d) which prohibits aerobatic flight within Class D and Class E surface areas, and within Federal airways. Additionally, the Department of Defense has been issued an authorization to operate aircraft at indicated airspeeds in excess of 250 knots below 10,000 feet MSL within active MOAs

Within regulatory and nonregulatory airspaces there are 4 types of airspaces. Controlled airspaces, Uncontrolled airspaces, Special Use, and Other airspaces.

Controlled and Uncontrolled Airspace

Controlled Airspaces are regulatory airspaces in which Air Traffic Control (ATC) services are provided. These services ATC provides vary with the type of Controlled Airspaces in which operations are being performed.

The most common services are IFR traffic separation and VFR traffic advisories (weather and traffics advisories) as workload permits. But what does this mean? It means that ATC will provide separation to all IFR traffics from other IFR and VFR traffics. Moreover, as workload permits and upon request (flight following) ATC will provide traffic and weather advisories to VFR traffics.

On terminal areas (Class C and B airspaces), approach/departure controllers (TRACON) will separate both IFR and VFR traffics from other IFR/VFR traffics. Approach/departure controllers will accommodate the arriving or departing aircraft in order to generate a smooth and organized flow of traffic.

During the takeoff, aircraft are in contact with tower controllers, and then they are handed off to departure control (TRACON) who vectors or clears them to the en-route segment (Class A airspace). Thereafter they continue the flight with Air Route Traffic Controllers (ARTCC) until they start the descent on the destination airport. During the arrival, aircraft in contact with ARTCC, are handed off to the Approach controllers (TRACON) who vectors or clears them into the airport, thereafter they are handed to the tower and cleared to land.

Controlled Airspaces types are defined based on the complexity or density of aircraft movements and the nature of the operations conducted within the airspace.

Controlled Airspace types

* Class A

The only uncontrolled airspace in the National Airspace System is the G airspace. It starts at the surface and goes up to 700 ft AGL, 1,200 ft AGL or 14,500 ft MSL depending on the floor of the overlying E airspace. Although ATC has no authority or responsibility to control air traffic, pilots should remember there are visual flight rules (VFR) minimums that apply to Class G airspace.

Here you can read a brief explanation of dimensions, operation and aircraft requirements, and VFR weather minimums for each controlled and uncontrolled airspace from the National Airspace System (NAS).

Class A

[14 CFR § 91.135](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/14/91.135)

Dimensions

* Generally, the airspace FROM 18,000 to Flight Level (FL) 600 including the airspace overlying the waters within 12 nautical miles (NM) of the coast of the 48 contiguous states and Alaska.
* It's basically the airspace in which en-route phase of the flights is developed
* The airspace is not depicted on the Sectional Charts

Operation Requirements

* All operations are performed under IFR, therefore an IFR flight plan should be filled and a clearance from ATC given prior to entering into A airspace.

Pilot Requirements

* At Least Private Pilot
* Instrument Flight Rules Rating (IFR)

Aircraft Requirements

* Two-way radio communications (Basically any aviation VHF radio)
* Transponder mode C and an Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B)

* If flying on Victor Airways, at least a VOR
* When flying above FL240, a Distance Measurement Equipment (DME) or a GPS is required.

Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Weather Minimums

* In Class A airspace, it's not possible to operate under VFR, therefore there aren't VFR Weather minimums.

Class B

[14 CFR Part § 91.131](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/14/91.131)

Dimensions

* Class B Airspace is found near the busiest airports of the country like LAX, MIA, IAH, etc.

Class G

[14 CFR Part § 91.126](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/14/91.126)

Class G airspace is the only uncontrolled airspace in the National Airspace System. As uncontrolled airspace, there are no requirements prior to entering and no ATC services are provided. G Airspace extends from the surface up to 1,200 ft AGL unless E airspace floor (magenta dashed lines, magenta shaded lines, blue shaded lines) are depicted as mentioned before. G airspace is always underneath E airspace unless another controlled airspace replaces the E airspace.

Dimensions

* On the VFR sectional chart:
* If not lines are depicted, G airspace extends up from the surface to 1,200 ft AGL
* If Magenta dashed lines are depicted on the chart, it means that there is no G airspace at all because E airspace goes all the way down to the surface
* If Magenta shaded lines are depicted on the chart, it means that G airspace starts at the surface and goes up to 700 ft AGL, then E airspace takes place all the way up to 17,999 ft MSL
* If Magenta shaded blue lines are depicted on the chart, it means that G airspace starts at the surface and goes up to 14,500 ft MSL, then E airspace takes place all the way up to 17,999 ft MSL

Operation Requirements

* It's uncontrolled airspace, therefore there is no operational requirement and there are no radar services provided in the airspace.

Pilot Requirements

* At least a student pilot certificate

Aircraft Requirements

* None

Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Weather Minimums

* If flying on G airspace below 1,200 AGL during the day
* 1 SM Flight Visibility
* Remain Clear of Clouds
* If flying on G airspace below 1,200 AGL during the night
